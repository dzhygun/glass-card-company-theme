# README

In order to make the `config.json` more readable, this theme splits up the config in multiple files in the
`card-glass-company-theme/config/` directory.

In order to compile the files into a single `config.json`, required by Publii, execute following script, it will place
the newly compiles .json file directly in theme root folder

```bash
./compile_config_json.sh
```
